R notebooks containing code for genomic offset analysis of japonica and indica landraces.

The comparisons notebooks are nearly identical except for being run on japonica and indica datasets. The rice displacement notebook contains code to find the least maladapted location across cultivable areas across Asia, for each landrace, under three different projected climate scenarios.
